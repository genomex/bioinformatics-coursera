  This project builds a class system using function and data structure and algorithm discussed in Chapter one.
  
  #### Task:
  
  Build a object oriented framework to manipulate large data of genome and implement it to extract the important result of counting genome kmer.
  
 
 ####  Method:
  
  Differnt class are defiend and dependency structure is used carefully to transfer data within the  functions in a class and between classes.
